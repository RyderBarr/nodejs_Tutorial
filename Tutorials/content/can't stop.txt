can't stop, addicted to the shindig
chop top, he says im gonna win big
choose not, a life of immitation 
distant cousin to the resorvation
defunckt, the piston that you paid for
this punk, the felling that you stayed for
in time i want to be best friend 
east side love is living on the west end
knocked out, but boy you better come to
don't die, you know the truth is some do
forgot
forgot
white heat, is burning in the jungle
complete the motion if you stumble
go ask the dust for any answers 
come back strong with 50 be!!ydancers
the world I love, the tears I drop 
to be part of the wave can't stop
ever wonder if its all for you
the world I love, the trains I hop
to be part of the world can't stop
come and tell me when it's time to
wait a minute im passing out, win or lose 
just like you
far more shocking then anything I ever knew 
how 'bout you
10 more reasons why I need somebody new
just like you 
forgot
right on cue
can't stop, addicted to the shindig
chop top, he says im gonna win big

distant cousin to the resorvation

this punk, the felling that you stayed for
in time i want to be best friend 
east side love is living on the west end
knocked out, but boy you better come to
don't die, you know the truth is some do
forgot

can't stop the spirts when they need you
